🎯 About the Project
FitLife India is a single-page web application (SPA) designed to help users track their health goals while staying rooted in Indian culture. Unlike generic fitness apps, FitLife focuses on:
Dietary Context: Tracking macros for common Indian foods (e.g., Roti, Dal, Sabzi).
Traditional Exercise: Highlighting Yoga Asanas, Pranayama (breathing exercises), and Desi workouts (Dand Baithak).
Privacy: All data is stored locally in the browser (localStorage), ensuring user privacy without the need for a backend server.

✨ Key Features

🍎 Nutrition Tracker
Daily Dashboard: Visual progress rings for Calories and progress bars for Macros (Protein, Carbs, Fats).
Micronutrient Tracking: Monitors Fiber, Sugar, and Sodium intake.
Food Logging: Easy-to-use form to add meals specific to Indian diets.
History: Saves daily logs to view trends over time.

🧘 Yoga & Exercise Library
Categorized View: Filter between Yoga Asanas, Pranayama, and Indian Exercises.
Detailed Modals: Click on any card to see:
Sanskrit Names.
Difficulty Levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

🎨 UI/UX Design
Dark Mode Aesthetic: Sophisticated dark theme with neon accents (Mint Green, Warm Orange, Gold).
Glassmorphism: Modern translucent card designs.
Responsive: Fully functional on Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.

🛠 Technology Stack
